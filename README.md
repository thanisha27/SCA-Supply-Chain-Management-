**COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY IN RETAIL AUTOMATIVE DEALERSHIPS USING AHP, TOPSIS AND EDAS**

In the dynamic landscape of retail, selecting the optimal retailer is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and overall business success. This research investigates the evaluation of three retail models through the implementation of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, specifically the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS). The study focuses on assessing nine key criteria that influence retail performance, including location proximity, facility convenience, showroom ambience, trained manpower availability, product range, demonstration effectiveness, sales and after-sales service, financial options, and value for money. Data was gathered through surveys with a rating scale from 1 to 9, based on feedback from 10 users. AHP was first applied to determine the criteria weights, which were subsequently utilized in the TOPSIS and EDAS models to rank the retailers. The findings provide a comparative analysis of the three retailers, highlighting the most suitable option based on customer-centric and operational factors. The results contribute valuable insights for decision-makers in the retail sector to optimize customer experience and service delivery.
